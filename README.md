## Model Number Explainer

<<<<<<< HEAD

=======
Open `index.html` in a browser to see a demo that explains TV model numbers. The page splits the model number into parts and shows lines connecting each part to its description. The connections use colorful 90Â° paths similar to explainshell.com and the explanation boxes are listed vertically. Hovering a part highlights it and its explanation.
